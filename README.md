# Code Overview for Aviaticket Price Predictor

Welcome to the Aviaticket Price Predictor! This tool is designed to help you forecast the prices of airline tickets with the power of machine learning. Whether you're a fellow coder, a data science enthusiast, or just curious about how it all works, here's a straightforward guide to what's under the hood.

## Simple Structure

Our project is organized into a few key files and folders:

- **Data Folder**: Here's where we keep the dataset. It's a collection of historical airline ticket prices and features that might affect those prices, like departure and arrival locations, dates, and more.
- **Notebooks Folder**: Contains a Jupyter notebook (`Aviaticket_price_predictor.ipynb`) that walks you through the data analysis, model building, and prediction steps. It's like a detailed recipe that shows you how we cook up our predictions.
- **Scripts Folder**: This includes Python scripts for specific tasks, such as data cleaning (`clean_data.py`), model training (`train_model.py`), and making predictions (`predict.py`). These scripts make it easy to handle different parts of the project without getting overwhelmed.

## Key Components Explained

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before we can predict anything, we need to make sure our data is clean and ready for analysis. This involves:

- **Removing Unnecessary Data**: Sometimes, datasets have extra information we don't need. We trim those out to keep things tidy.
- **Filling in Missing Values**: Missing data can throw off our predictions. We have smart ways to fill in those gaps.
- **Converting Categories to Numbers**: Computers like numbers, so we convert categorical data (like city names) into a numeric format.

### Model Building and Training

This is where the magic happens. We use machine learning algorithms to learn from the historical data. This process involves:

- **Choosing a Model**: We start with simple models and gradually try more complex ones to see what works best.
- **Feeding Data to the Model**: We give our cleaned data to the model so it can learn the patterns.
- **Tuning Parameters**: Just like tuning a musical instrument, we adjust the settings to get the best performance out of our model.

### Making Predictions

With our model trained, we can now predict the prices of airline tickets based on new data. This step involves:

- **Input Data**: You provide details about the flight you're interested in (like departure city, arrival city, and date).
- **The Prediction**: Our model uses what it has learned to predict the ticket price for your flight.

## Why This Matters

Understanding the price dynamics of airline tickets can save you money and make travel planning easier. By breaking down the process into manageable steps, we aim to demystify how machine learning can be applied in practical, real-world scenarios.

## Final Thoughts

We hope this guide helps you grasp the basics of how the Aviaticket Price Predictor works. Remember, the best way to learn is by doing, so feel free to dive into the code, experiment with it, and see what you can create!
